## About
In this project, we used Pandas dataframes to analyze crowdfunding data in Jupyter Notebook. We created 4 dataframes to represent the study's findings. The dataframes were titled campaign, category, contacts, and subcategory. Our campaign dataframe shows the outcomes of the crowdfunding. Our contacts dataframe shows the names of the participants and their email addresses. Our category and subcategory dataframes assigned IDs to each category and subcategory. Once the dataframes were complete, we created an entity-relationship diagram and used SQL to query the data.

## Getting Started
Jupyter Notebook and pgAdmin are required to run this project.
